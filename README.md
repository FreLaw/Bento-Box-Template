This is a first experiment to test Tailwind CSS. I decided to replicate a bento-box style design. Unfortunately, not having either images or the precise font (I only found paid options), to remain more faithful to the original model, I decided to treat spaces as images. However, the HTML/Tailwind code can be easily reused as a template to insert a bento box of these dimensions and shapes into a regular webpage.
